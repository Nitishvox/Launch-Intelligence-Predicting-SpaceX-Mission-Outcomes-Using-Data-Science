## Overview

This project utilizes publicly available SpaceX launch data to build predictive models that classify mission outcomes based on operational parameters. The process includes:

- API-based data acquisition and wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis using visualizations
- Feature engineering and model development
- Evaluation using accuracy, recall, and confusion matrix
- Interactive analytics with Folium maps and Plotly Dash

## Key Deliverables

- Cleaned launch dataset (structured from nested JSON)
- Visual insights into payload and recovery patterns
- Random Forest model with 95% predictive accuracy
- Dash dashboard with mission filters and graphs
- Interactive launch site mapping with Folium
